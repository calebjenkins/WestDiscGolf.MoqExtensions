## Installing KeyValueRepo

You should install [Extensions with NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Calebs.KeyValueRepo):

    Install-Package **Coming.Soon **
    
Or via the .NET Core command line interface:

    dotnet add package **Coming.Soon**

Either command, from Package Manager Console or .NET Core CLI, will download and install all required dependencies.

## Contributing - Coming Soon
- PRs should be against the `Develop` branch.
- Merged PRs to `Develop` will trigger a `[version]-ci-[buildnumber]` deployment to nuget, assuming all unit tests pass.
- Merged PRs to `Main` will trigger a [version] deployment to nuget, assuming all of the tests pass.

## Versioning
The package `version` is defined in the `MoqExtensions.csproj` file, using .NET SDK style structure. We follow `semantic versioning` for this package.
